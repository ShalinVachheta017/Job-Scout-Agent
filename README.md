# 🤖 Job Scout Agent

## Project Summary

### What is this project?
This project gathers job listings and organizes them in a report.

### Why is it interesting?
Checking several job websites manually every day takes time.

### How does it work?
Scripts collect listings and format the information for review.

### Real-life example
Instead of opening many career pages every morning, you review one collected report. It does not apply for you.

### What did I learn?
I practiced collecting web information, scheduling tasks, and creating useful reports.
